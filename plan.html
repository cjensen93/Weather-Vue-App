    <h2>index.html</h2>
    <p>This website will be very simple, when it comes down to it. It will make 3 different API calls, and based off
    of the data it returns, will populate the entire site. The website will all be contained inside different if-else
    divs, depending on if the different data fields are populated by the APIs.</p>

    <p>First, I will be testing out my API calls on their own, to make sure I am able to retrieve the correct
    information. Here's the API keys that I will use:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>IP Address API: <code>https://api.freegeoip.app/json/?apikey=5dd73610-531f-11ec-81be-8d8e0748abd7</code></li>
        <li>Current Weather API: <code>https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=(latitude}&lon={longitude}&units=imperial&appid={APIKey}</code></li>
        <li>Forecast Weather API: <code>https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}&units=imperial&appid={APIKey}</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The API calls will be nested in the way the professor showed us in his Fantasy Character website. They'll be
    called one at a time, with the first one being the original 'fetch', and the subsequent ones being called in the
    'return' of the previous fetch call. </p>
</div>

<div class="green shadowed stuff-box">
    <h2>Current Location div</h2>
    <p>This div will be a 'v-if' and 'v-else' type. It will depend on if the API has filled a variable with its JSON
    data. If the variable type is still equal to 'undefined', it will load the div to say something like "fetching your
    current location". This div will pop up initially with the "fetching data" message, because the variable will be
    initialized as undefined. But, shortly after, the API will obtain the IP information, and the div will change to
    its 'v-else' state. In this state, the div will display the users country, region name, city, and the users
    longitude and latitude. This information will help the next section run.</p>
</div>

<div class="yellow shadowed stuff-box">
    <h2>Current Weather div</h2>
    <p>This div will also be a 'v-if' and 'v-else' type. It will depend on the API being able to use the returned
    longitude and latitude to get the users weather based off of their current location. To start off, the div will
    display something like "obtaining your current weather data". But, like the first div, this div will load the data
    from API, and the div will change to its 'v-else' state. In this state, the div will display a lot of information
    gathered from the API. These include the current temp, the day's low and the day's high, its humidity, its pressure,
    its sunrise, and its sunset.</p>
</div>

<div class="cyan shadowed stuff-box">
    <h2>Forecast Weather div</h2>
    <p>This div will also be a 'v-if' and 'v-else' type. The API will return a similar data set as the last one, from
    the same website. But this data set will be not just for the current forecast, but for 40 forecasts in 3 hour
    intervals over the next 5 days. This div will start in its 'v-if' state, because the variable it depends on will
    be initialized as 'undefined'. But once the API load the data, it will switch to its 'v-else' state. Inside this
    div will be a 'v-for' loop based on the length of the 40 forecasts return (which, obviously, will be 40). For each
    of these divs that are created, it will be given a "data-idx" property that will match the iteration the loop is
    currently in. This will be used to access the location in the data set list. Inside each div, we will focus on
    displaying the forecasts date/time, its temperature, its description, its humidity, and its pressure.</p>
</div>

<div class="magenta shadowed stuff-box">
    <h2>Voting System</h2>
    <p>At the top of the "Forecast Weather" div, I'll create three "h3" elements that are lined up side by side. The
    first will track the 'unlikely' votes, and will be colored red. The second will track the 'neutral' votes, and be
    colored grey. The last will track the 'likely' votes, and will be colored green.</p>

    <p>Inside the Vue app that is created, three of the variables that will be passed in the "data" function will be
    used to track the current values of the votes. Because the website will default to all the divs and votes being
    neutral and grey, the red and green counters will be 0, and the grey counter will be 40. From here, inside the
    function that cycles between the div colors, will also be a function that increases the color that is switched to
    by one, and decreases the color it was switched from by one. These variables will be tracked withing the 'computed'
    section of the Vue app, so every time the website changes, it will track it and update the variable inside the 'h3'
    element to the user.</p>
</div>

<div class="black shadowed stuff-box">
    <h2>Vue App</h2>
    <p>This app will follow fairly closely to the tutorial 'TODO' app that was shown by the professor. It will have a
    'data()' section, a methods section, a computed section, and a created section. At the end, the app will be mounted
    to the 'div' that contains all the elements of the body. The created section will be a little longer, as described
    earlier in the plan. The different API calls will be nested inside  each other, to avoid the "hadouken" style calls.</p>
